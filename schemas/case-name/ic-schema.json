  "description": "The json file that conforms to this schema has to be named ic.json. It containts the nodal and pipe initial conditions. For the nodes, it is the pressure and for the pipes the flow and pressure have to be specified. If the initial conditions are steady-state, then the pipe flow can be a number. If all the initial conditions are transient then, the pipe flow and pressure have to be specified as functions of distance (using a format similar to time-series). Typically these can be obtained by saving the output state after a transient solve and are generated by saving the terminal state of a transient simulation. Only steady initial conditions are usually provided. ",
