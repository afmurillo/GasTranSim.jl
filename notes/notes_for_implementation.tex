\section{Introduction}

For a single pipe, the scheme is easy to understand and implement when given the initial conditions and the boundary conditions. However,  complications arise when we apply it for a network of pipes and compressors.

To start with, for each pipe, assume a base grid  of  pressure/density $(p/\rho)$ that matches the end-points, so that the grid for flux $\phi$ is staggered.  

Given initial conditions for both variables (pressure/density and flux), it is possible to advance all the internal nodes for flux to the next time instant (here $\Delta t/2$) by using the discretized equation of balance of mass.  The pressure at the nodes at $\Delta t$ however, cannot be calculated independently, and we need to satisfy the nodal balance, get the nodal pressures, before one can advance the internal pressure nodes to the next time level $\Delta t$.

For this we shall use the flux at the end points, corresponding to the values at the ghost points, given by
\begin{align}
 s \phi_R^{n+1/2} = -\frac{s \Delta x}{\Delta t}\rho^{n+1} + \frac{s \Delta x}{\Delta t}\rho^{n} + s\phi_R^{-} \\
 s \phi_L^{n+1/2} = \frac{s \Delta x}{\Delta t}\rho^{n+1} - \frac{s \Delta x}{\Delta t}\rho^{n} + s\phi_L^{-}
\end{align}
where $\phi_R^{-}, \phi_L^{-1}$ are the internal nodes for flux closest to the ghost points. 
We use the letters $L, R$ to denote the left and right ends, where flow is assumed to be from left to right.

\section{Network without compressors}

At a node, say $i_0$, suppose there are incoming pipes $i_1, i_2, i_3, \dotsc$, outgoing pipes $o_1, o_2, o_3, ...$, and supply $q_{i_0}(t)$. We assume that for pipe $i$, $\sgn(i) = +1$ if incoming, and $-1$ if outgoing, and supply is positive, withdrawal is negative. The notation $u \in e(i_0)$ will be used to denote a pipe $u$ that has node $i_0$ as one end. 

Then, we can substitute pipe fluxes in terms of densities from above to get
\begin{equation}
\left[\sum_{u \in e(i_0)}\frac{s_u \Delta x_u}{\Delta t}\right]\rho^{n+1}(i_0) = q_{i_0}(t) + \left[\sum_{u \in e(i_0)}\frac{s_u \Delta x_u}{\Delta t}\right]\rho^{n}(i_0) + \sum_{u \in e(i_0)}\sgn(u) s_u \phi_{u}^-(i_0) 
\end{equation}
where $\phi_{u}^-(i_0)$ indicates that we want the flux value $\phi^-$ at the end $i_0$ for the pipe $u$, and $s_u$ stands for cross-sectional area of pipe $u$.

This equation can be solved for $\rho^{n+1}(i_0)$ since everything else is known.

Thus the algorithm may be understood as the sequence of steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Given $\rho^n$ everywhere, and $\phi^{n+1/2}$ at all internal nodes in network (initial condition)	
 \item Calculate $\rho^{n+1}$ for all internal nodes of all pipes 
 \item Find $\rho^{n+1}$ on pipe boundary (graph nodes)
 \item Now calculate $\phi^{n+1 + 1/2}$ for all \emph{internal} nodes of all pipes
 \item $phi^{n+1/2}$ at pipe ends can only be calculated when $\rho^n, \rho^{n+1}$ are known.
 \end{enumerate} 
Note that if the node $i_0$ is a \emph{slack node}, then the pressure $p(i_0)$ is always known and there is nothing to do.


\section{Network with compressors}
For a compressor $c$ between nodes $i$ and $j$, it is assumed that the flow is unidirectional only. That is, \emph{we do not deal with flows wherein $\alpha \geq 1$ in one flow direction and $\alpha=1$  if  flow is in the reverse direction.} 
Moreover, one of the following \emph{must} be known/given: \\
(a) mass flow through compressor $f_c(t)$ \\
(b) Compressor ratio $\alpha_c(t)$ \\
(c) Discharge pressure of compressor \\ 

\subsection{Mass flow given}

If at a node $i_0$, we have a compressor with condition (a), we can treat the given mass flux $f_c(t)$ as a supply term and add $\sgn(c)f_c(t)$ on the RHS. Once again, the sign is +1 for incoming compressor and -1 for outgoing.
Same process is followed if we have multiple compressors at a node $i_0$ with condition (a).

\subsection{Compressor ratios given}

For reasons that will become clear subsequently, we assume that our network is such that if a compressor $c$ has nodes $i$ and $j$, at least one of $i$ or $j$  must be such that $c$ is the only compressor attached to that node. Let us record the implication of this statement  carefully.
This statement \emph{does not} rule out nodes where multiple compressors connect. Neither does it prohibit  such nodes from being neighbours. It only prevents the connecting edge between two such nodes from being a compressor. Stated another way, if nodes $i, j$ have multiple compressors, our assumption rules out a compressor connecting $i,j$. 

Given a network satisfying the restriction, let us start by considering all \emph{slack} nodes first.
At a slack node $i_0$, if there is a compressor $c$ with compressor ratio $\alpha_c$, then the density at the node lying at other end of  the compressor is given by multiplying factor $\alpha_c$ if compressor is outgoing at $i_0 \; (\sgn(c) = -1$, but the factor is $1/\alpha_c$ when $\sgn(c) = +1$, i.e., incoming at $i_0$.



Now for a non-slack node $i_0$, we have multiple incoming/outgoing, incoming compressor $ic$ and outgoing compressor $oc$ whose ends are nodes $I$ and $O$ respectively.
Let us suppose that at the other end of $ic$, which is node $I$, there is supply $q_{I}(t)$, and pipes $e(I)$ and similarly for compressor $oc$ at node $O$.

Then, we have $\rho^{n+1}(i_0) = N/D$ 
where
\begin{align*}
N = & \sum_{u \in e(i_0)}\frac{s_u \Delta x_u}{\Delta t}\rho^n(i_0) +  \sum_{u \in e(i_0) }\sgn(u) s_u \phi_{u}^-(i_0) + q_{i_0}(t) \\ 
& \sum_{v \in e(I)}\frac{1}{\alpha_{ic}} \frac{s_{v} \Delta x_{v}}{\Delta t} \rho^n(i_0) + 
+ \sum_{v \in e(I)}\sgn(v) s_{v} \phi_{v}^-(I) + q_I(t) \\
& \sum_{w \in e(O)}\alpha_{oc} \frac{s_{w} \Delta x_{w}}{\Delta t} \rho^n(i_0) 
\sum_{w \in e(O)}\sgn(w) s_{w} \phi_{w}^-(O) +  q_{O}(t)   \\
\end{align*}


and $$D = \sum_{u \in e(i_0)}\frac{s_u \Delta x_u}{\Delta t} + 
\sum_{v \in e(I)}\frac{1}{\alpha_{ic}} \frac{s_{v} \Delta x_{v}}{\Delta t}  + 
\sum_{w \in e(O)}\alpha_{oc} \frac{s_{w} \Delta x_{w}}{\Delta t} $$

We can now see that the assumption we made about the network prevents the stencil for the given node from expanding further than  the other end of the compressors.

\subsection{Delivery pressure given}

If at node $i_0$, there are multiple pipes but  a single compressor $c$ (from node $I$) that delivers with given pressure $p(i_0)$, then one can write
\begin{equation}
\sum_{u \in e(i_0)} \sgn(u) s_u\phi_u^{n+1/2}(i_0) + f_c(t) = q_{i_0}(t) 
\end{equation}
Now $\phi_u(i_0)$ may be computed in terms of $\rho^{n+1}(i_0), \rho^{n}(i_0), \phi_{u}^-(i_0)$ so that one solves for $f_c(t)$. Once known, the flux is used at node $I$ on other end of $c$ to find the pressure, and thus the value of $\alpha$ is determined.

Let us write out the final equation after eliminating $f_c(t)$.

\begin{align*}
D = & \sum_{v \in e(I)} \frac{s_{v} \Delta x_{v}}{\Delta t} \\
N = & \left[\sum_{v \in e(I)} \frac{s_{v} \Delta x_{v}}{\Delta t}\right]\rho^n(I) + 
\sum_{v \in e(I)}\sgn(v) s_{v} \phi_{v}^-(I) + q_{I}(t) \\
& + \left[\sum_{u \in e(i_0)} \frac{s_{u} \Delta x_{u}}{\Delta t}\right][\rho^n(i_0) - \rho^{n+1}(i_0)] + \sum_{u \in e(i_0)}\sgn(u) s_{u} \phi_{u}^-(i_0) + q_{i_0}(t) \\
\rho^{n+1}(I) = & N/D \\
\end{align*}


Note that if there are two compressors delivering to same node with a given delivery pressure, then it is not possible to  solve for both mass flows from one equation. Even if we develop equations for the nodes at other end of the compressors, $\alpha$ being unknown means that we cannot eliminate any quantities and solve. This is a limitation of this formulation and hence 
\emph{we shall not consider networks where, at a node more than one compressor delivers with specified pressure.}

\subsection{Combination of above given}
Let us introduce the terms Level 0 and Level 1 vertices first. At a Level 0 vertex there are no incoming or outgoing compressors. At a Level 1 vertex, there can be compressors attached, but the vertex at the other end of each compressor has no other compressors incoming or outgoing. 
We shall write down the equations for the pressure of a  general Level 1 vertex in two common configurations, and this will ensure that once all Level 1 vertices of the network have been updated, no vertices remain untouched. 

\subsection{Configuration 1}
\begin{figure}[htb]
\includegraphics[scale=1]{fig1}
\caption{Configuration 1: Landing at vertex $i$, and determining vertex densities at neighbours}
\label{fig:config1}
\end{figure}

The density at vertex $i$ in the configuration in Figure~\ref{fig:config1} is determined through

\begin{align}
& \left[ \sum_{u \in e(i)}\frac{s_{u} \Delta x_{u}}{\Delta t} + \sum_{u \in e(j_2)}\alpha_{c_2}\frac{s_{u} \Delta x_{u}}{\Delta t} \right] \left( \rho^{n+1}(i) - \rho^n(i) \right) =  \sum_{v \in e(j_4)}\left[\frac{s_{v} \Delta x_{v}}{\Delta t}\right] \cdot \left(\rho^{n}(j_4) - \rho^{(n+1)}(j_4) \right) \notag \\
& + \sum_{v \in e(j_5)}\left[\frac{s_{v} \Delta x_{v}}{\Delta t}\right] \cdot \left(\rho^{n}(j_5) - \rho^{(n+1)}(j_5) \right) 
+\sum_{v \in \{j_2, j_4, j_5, i\}} \left( q^{(n+1/2)}_{v}(t) + \sum_{u \in e(v)}\sgn(u) s_{u} \phi_{u-}^{(n+1/2)}(v) \right) + f^{(n+1/2)}_{c_3}
\label{eqn:config1}
\end{align}

Since $\rho^{(n+1)}(j_4), \rho^{(n+1)}(j_5)$ are already known, once $\rho^{(n+1)}(i)$ is determined from \eqref{eqn:config1}, $\rho^{(n+1)}(j_2)$ is also found. 
In this configuration (Figure~\ref{fig:config1}), we \emph{do not} solve for $\rho^{(n+1)}(j_3)$ but it will be determined separately when we land at vertex $j_3$. The treatment of vertex $j_3$ is different because the compressor $c_3$ has mass-flow specified, and thus it is treated similar to the injection $q(i)$  at the vertex $i$.


\subsection{Configuration 2}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=1]{fig2}
\caption{Configuration 2: Landing at vertex $i$, and determining vertex densities at neighbours}
\label{fig:config2}
\end{figure}

In this scenario (see Figure~\ref{fig:config2}, the density at the base vertex $i$ is already known, since we have now reversed the direction of compressor $c_4$. However, we develop the equations for density at vertex $j_4$ as 

\begin{align}
& \left[ \sum_{u \in e(j_4)}\frac{s_{u} \Delta x_{u}}{\Delta t} \right] \left ( \rho^{n+1}(j_4) - \rho^{n}(j_4) \right)  = \sum_{v \in e(j_5)}\left[\frac{s_{v} \Delta x_{v}}{\Delta t}\right] \cdot \left(\rho^{n}(j_5) - \rho^{(n+1)}(j_5) \right)  \notag \\
& + \left[ \sum_{u \in e(i)}\frac{s_{u} \Delta x_{u}}{\Delta t} + \sum_{u \in e(j_2)}\alpha_{c_2}\frac{s_{u} \Delta x_{u}}{\Delta t} \right]\left( \rho^n(i) - \rho^{n+1}(i) \right) \notag \\
& +\sum_{v \in \{j_2, j_4, j_5, i\}} \left( q^{(n+1/2)}_{v}(t) + \sum_{u \in e(v)}\sgn(u) s_{u} \phi_{u-}^{(n+1/2)}(v) \right) + f^{(n+1/2)}_{c_3}
\label{eqn:config2}
\end{align}

It can be seen that equations \eqref{eqn:config1} and \eqref{eqn:config2} 
are identical; we have simply transposed terms to reflect the known and unknown terms.

\begin{itemize}
\item The case of multiple incoming/outgoing compressors such as $c_2$ with given compressor ratios, is easy to generalize. The compressor ratio will appear as $1/\alpha_c$ for incoming compressors in \eqref{eqn:config1}, \eqref{eqn:config2}. 
\item Similarly multiple compressors with given massflux are handled in the same way as  $c_3$.
\item Multiple outgoing compressors with discharge pressure control, such as $c_4$, $c_5$ in Figure~\ref{fig:config1} are no problem.
\item However, if $c_4$ be incoming, it must be the sole incoming compressor with discharge pressure control. Else the vertex equations cannot be solved locally.
\end{itemize}

\section{Data structures and order of operations}
\begin{enumerate}
\item For a pipe between nodes $i, j$, there will be a grid for $\rho, \phi$. Also, a field to access $\phi^-(i), \phi^-(j)$.
\item For each node, a flag to indicate if its pressure value has been updated in this current step.
\item For each node, a list of \emph{all} pipes and compressors that are going to be relevant to the computation, a flag to indicate incoming/outgoing, and a compressor ratio (set to 1 if pipe). Note that this might include information about pipes at neighbouring nodes if compressors with unknown fluxes are present.
\item Then visit each node, check if pressure value update flag is true; if so, exit and go to next node. Else perform computations at node, and update pressure at neighbouring nodes if relevant.
\item Once all nodes updated, reset pressure update flag to false
\item Now update fluxes
\item We can start with a steady-state solution of $\phi, \rho$ as initial conditions, where we will assume that the nodal injections of the steady-state problem are held constant for time interval $[0, \Delta t/2]$
\end{enumerate}

\section{Global formulation}

The fool-proof way to solve this problem without restrictions on network topology is to form the full matrix system and solve all together.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Proceed as follows to first calculate the numbers of dofs in the problem, given that there are $N$ nodes in total, of which $N_s$ are slack nodes, and there are $n_c$ compressors.
\item The number of nodal pressure dofs would be $N - N_s$. 
\item For each compressor, we create either (i) 2 dofs, $f_c, 1/\alpha_c$ if delivery pressure is specified or (ii) single dof $f_c$ if $\alpha_c$ is specified, or (iii) no dofs if $f_c(t)$ is given.
\item For each of the $N- N_s$ nodes $i_0$, we write the balance equation that involves the nodal pressure $p(i_0)$, and compressor mass fluxes $f_c$ if unknown. 
\item For each compressor for which $f_c$ is unknown, we write an equation. Either $(1/\alpha_c)p(i_0) - p(j) = 0$ if $\alpha_c$ is given. Else if delivery pressure $p_d$ is given, then $(p_d)1/\alpha_c - p(j) = 0$.
\item The dofs thus comprise of $p_i, f_c, 1/\alpha_c$. If all compressors have mass flow given, only $p_i$ to solve for. If all compressors have $\alpha_c$ given, then solve for $p_i, f_c$.
\item Will need to have a node to dof map and vice versa for use in every time step.
\item The system matrix will be sparse, but because $\alpha_c(t)$ and $\Delta t$ may change with every time step, will need to evaluate in each step. RHS depends on previous time step solution, hence obviously needs updating each step.

\end{enumerate}
